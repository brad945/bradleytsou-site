/**
 * Live stats from DevEval's own API. (The product was called CodeArena until
 * mid-2026; the backing repo is still `codearenamvp`.)
 *
 * The rest of this site proves "every number is fetched, not written" using
 * someone else's API. This block does it with Bradley's own product, which is
 * the part that actually says something about him.
 *
 * Configured by `DEVEVAL_STATS_URL`. With no endpoint set — or if the
 * endpoint is down, slow, or returns something unexpected — this returns null
 * and the sidebar block hides itself. It never invents a number and never
 * throws.
 *
 * The endpoint should return JSON with any subset of these keys:
 *
 *   { "submissions": 1204, "matches": 318, "players": 96, "problems": 42 }
 *
 * Unknown keys are ignored, and non-finite values are dropped, so a malformed
 * or partially-migrated response degrades to fewer rows rather than rendering
 * "NaN" on the page.
