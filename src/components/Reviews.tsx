 * Steam's review format, applied to things that aren't games.

 * compresses taste into a verdict, a number and one line — which is a far
 * better shape for "what am I like" than a paragraph, and it's the one Steam
 * surface the profile page never used.
 *
 * The verdict bar on the left is Steam's own tell, and the colours are the
 * site's `live` / `danger`: green means recommended everywhere else on the
 * internet, so it doesn't need a legend.
