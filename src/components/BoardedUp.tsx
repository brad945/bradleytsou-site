/**
 * The "Coming soon" cover, rendered in place of the profile grid while
 * `privacyScreen` is on.
 *
 * It replaces that block rather than sitting on top of it. An overlay was
 * tried first and couldn't hold: it lived inside the clipped wrapper, so an
 * anchor jump from the nav scrolled the container and carried the cover off
 * with it, and every link underneath stayed in the tab order however opaque
 * the thing painted over it was. Covering pixels doesn't disable a document.
 *
 * Because the grid isn't rendered, nothing behind this is reachable by click,
 * keyboard or View Source, and `page.tsx` still hands the fetched data to a
 * branch that never runs. No component below was edited to make that work —
 * the whole change is which branch renders.

        Tracking is near-zero, not the 0.06em this carried under Bebas. That
        was there because Bebas is caps-only and tightly fitted; Gabarito has
        lowercase and normal sidebearings, so the same value would space it
        out. Which also means the line renders sentence case now rather than
        the all-caps Bebas forced.
