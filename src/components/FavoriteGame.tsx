/**
 * Steam's "Favorite Game" slot, holding an actual game.
 *
 * **This replaced Favorite Project**, which held DevEval — already the first
 * row of Experience & Projects, so the panel restated something the page had
 * just said. A favourite game is the thing the slot is for, and it's the one
 * fact here that nothing else on the page carries.
 *
 * ## The numbers
 *
 * Hours come from Steam's Web API — see `lib/steam.ts` for why that needs a
 * key even though the profile is public. **Without them the panel still
 * renders**, minus the stat row: the favourite is hand-picked and true whether
 * or not the hours are reachable, so hiding the whole thing would lose a real
 * fact to protect a missing one. That's the opposite call from the DevEval
 * block, which is *only* numbers and so has nothing left to show.
 *
 * "hours on record" and "past 2 weeks" are Steam's own labels, deliberately —
 * the second is a figure Steam puts in exactly this slot, and renaming it
 * would break the one thing a visitor already knows how to read.
 *
 * They're also the only text here besides the name and the blurb. A "live from
 * Steam" tag in the panel bar and a "Valve · 2023" line under the name were
 * both cut at Bradley's request: the first captioned the numbers with the fact
 * that they're fetched, which the whole site already asserts everywhere, and
 * the second stated who made the game rather than anything about him.

          Valve's CS2 mark, supplied by Bradley — the second Steam-owned asset
          on the site after the Years of Service badges, and the same call: he
          asked for it directly, against the carve-out that otherwise generates
          every tile from the palette. It's the game's logo, not a store
          capsule, so the "no capsule art" half of that rule still holds.

          Sourced at 256px for a 84px slot, past 2x on any display. Its gold
          (240,176,66) lands within a few points of `accent` (#de9b35), so no
          frame is needed to tie it to the page — a border here just fought
          the artwork. `shrink-0` so it can't be squeezed when the name wraps.

          The logo links too, and is hidden from assistive tech rather than
          given its own label. It points at the same place as the name right
          beside it, so a second announced link would just be the same
          destination read twice — `aria-hidden` plus `tabIndex={-1}` keeps it
          out of the tab order and out of the accessibility tree while leaving
          it clickable, which is what a duplicated image link should do.
