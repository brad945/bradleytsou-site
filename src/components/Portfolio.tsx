/**
 * Portfolio — the built things, on `/about`.
 *
 * **These rows used to live in Experience & Projects on `/`**, and moved here
 * at Bradley's request. The two pages now split along a cleaner line than
 * before: `/` is the record an employer reads — roles, dates, orgs, who he
 * worked for — and `/about` is everything he made or likes, which is what a
 * portfolio is.
 *
 * It shares `Row` with Experience rather than restyling. The row shape is
 * Steam's "recently played" line and it's the one piece of layout both panels
 * genuinely have in common; two copies of it would drift the first time either
 * page was touched.
 *
 * Order is manual, as it is everywhere on this site — groups in the order
 * `portfolioCategories` lists them, rows in the order they're authored in
 * `projects`. A date sort was tried on the old merged panel and reverted
 * within the hour; the reasoning is recorded there and it applies here too.
 *
 * **Groups render even when empty**, with a line saying so. Two of them are
 * empty today because Bradley asked for the headings ahead of the work, and a
 * heading over nothing is the thing this site removed from the profile page
 * once already — so it gets the same treatment `PlannedSources` gives an
 * unbuilt source in Recent Activity, which is to say what isn't there instead
 * of leaving a hole.

/*
 * `kind` — Software / Design / Research — is no longer rendered, at Bradley's
 * request. It sat under each name as a subtitle and said the least of anything
 * on the row: the blurb already tells you what the thing is, and on a page
 * where six of seven entries are "Software" it was a column of the same word.
 *
 * The field stays on `Project`. It's a real classification and it's cheap to
 * keep, but note it now joins `rarity` as data nothing displays — so nothing
 * on the page can check it.

                nothing alike: `.label` is 10px uppercase mono with 0.18em
                tracking, which this file's own notes call the single most
                un-Steam thing you can add, and it's scoped to tiny chrome
                labels for that reason. A group heading is page text, so it
                takes the page's own 14px — the same class the source names in
                Recent Activity use.

                No colour override on it either, so it lands on `t-label`'s own
                `muted` (#8f98a0). That's Bradley's "grey but obvious": a true
                grey rather than the blue-grey `copy` it had, and still well
                clear of the panel behind it. It reads as a label for the rows
                under it instead of competing with their titles.
