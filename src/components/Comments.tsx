/**
 * giscus-backed comments — real GitHub Discussions, not a fake widget.
 *
 * The whole thread lives on `brad945/bradleytsou-site`; visitors sign in with
 * their own GitHub account and their comments are real discussion replies.
 * Nothing is stored here, which is the point — the site has no backend, and a
 * comment box that pretended to work would be exactly the fake chrome this
 * page avoids.
 *
 * ## The ids
 *
 * `repoId` and `categoryId` are GitHub's GraphQL node ids, read off the API
 * rather than copied out of giscus.app — the same values that page generates.
 * They're **not secret**: giscus is a client-side script, so every visitor
 * receives them. They only identify which repo and category to post into.
 *
 * The category is **Announcements**, and the type matters more than the name:
 * only maintainers can open discussions in an Announcement-format category, so
 * a stranger can't create one for giscus to then adopt as a page's thread.
 * `data-strict` narrows that further. Swapping to a dedicated "Comments"
 * category later is a one-line id change.
 *
 * ## Pinned to one discussion by number, not found by search
 *
 * `data-mapping="number"` with term `1` loads
 * github.com/brad945/bradleytsou-site/discussions/1 directly.
 *
 * **This replaced `pathname` mapping, which was broken in practice.** Pathname
 * mapping makes giscus *search* GitHub for a discussion whose title matches
 * the path, and GitHub's search index lags creation by minutes. So giscus
 * created the discussion, then couldn't find the thing it had just made:
 * it rendered an empty box, and pressing Comment tried to create the
 * discussion a second time and silently failed. Discussion 1 exists with zero
 * comments because of exactly that.
 *
 * Loading by number does no search at all, so there's no lag, no fuzzy title
 * matching, and no way for a stranger's discussion to be adopted as this
 * page's thread. `data-strict` went with the search — it only tuned matching.
 *
 * The cost is that this is now **one fixed guestbook thread** rather than one
 * per path. On a one-page site that was already true; it's just explicit now.
 * A second commentable page would need its own discussion and its own number.
 *
 * If it renders an error box, the giscus app isn't installed on the repo:
 * https://github.com/apps/giscus
