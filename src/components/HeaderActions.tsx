 * equivalent, and a menu of dead entries is exactly the kind of fake chrome
 * this site avoids. Every item is a working link.
 *
 * ## Message is a menu, not a mailto link
 *
 * It was `<a href="mailto:…">`, and on Windows that frequently **does nothing
 * at all** — if no application is registered for the mailto: protocol, which
 * is the default state of a Windows install with no desktop mail client, the
 * browser swallows the click silently. No error, no new window. Bradley hit
 * exactly that.
 *
 * There's no way to detect the failure: the navigation is handed to the OS and
 * the page is never told what happened. So the fix isn't a fallback, it's not
 * relying on the protocol in the first place — the menu offers the mail app,
 * a webmail compose URL that only needs a browser, and copying the address.
 * At least one of those works on any machine.
