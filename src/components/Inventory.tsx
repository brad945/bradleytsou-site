/**
 * Real objects as an inventory grid.
 *
 * **This is where the `rarity` field finally renders again.** The Item
 * Showcase used it to rank projects and was deleted; the field stayed in the
 * data with nothing showing it. Here it answers a different question — how
 * much of his life the thing takes up, not how central it is to his work —
 * which is the same split as the two pages.
 *
 * Tiles are monogram capsules built from the palette, the way every capsule on
 * this site is. A monogram isn't self-describing the way item art is, so the
 * name and a line of detail sit under each one rather than in a `title`, which
 * never fires on touch anyway.
