              18 / 10 total band. The 1px bevel border counts toward that, so
              the padding is 17 / 9. Bigger and it stops reading as a frame.

              Both scale with the photo — they're percentages of it, so a
              resize means recomputing them rather than keeping the old px.

              The band is not flat: it's a raised bevel. Light on the top and
              left edges, dark on the bottom and right, with the photo sitting
              in a sunken well (the reverse) below it.

            {/*
              Exy hides behind the photo, and only his tail shows.

              `#exy-den` is an empty anchor, not the sprite — the sprite and
              all of his state live in `components/Exy.tsx`, which portals into
              this element once it's mounted. That keeps one component owning
              whether he's asleep, awake or walking, and leaves this file
              owning only *where* he hides. No props, no context, no lifted
              state.

              **It must stay before the frame in DOM order.** Both are
              positioned with `z-index: auto`, so the later sibling paints on
              top — which is what puts the photo over him and leaves only the
              tail poking out. It's also what makes the click target correct:
              the covered part of the tail isn't clickable because the frame is
              genuinely over it.

              **Sized explicitly, and offset with `left`, not `right-full` plus
              a percentage translate.** That was the first spelling and the
              tail never appeared: an absolutely positioned box with
              `right: 100%` and `width: auto` shrink-to-fits against the space
              between the containing block's left edge and its own right edge —
              which is zero here — and a percentage translate on top of that
              resolves against whatever width it ended up with. Stating the
              77x86 outright removes both.

              **Left edge, not right, and that's a measurement rather than a
              preference.** 32px of the tail stands clear of the frame. On the
              right that lands it inside the bio text, only a 20px `gap-5`
              away, which paints over him — a fluffy tail behind the words. On
              the left it has the header's `p-6` plus the column's `px-4`,
              ~40px of empty margin, and touches nothing. Pushing further out
              than 32 walks the tip toward the black surround and it starts to
              read as falling off the card.

              77x86 is the tail asset at its render height; changing
              `TAIL_PX` in Exy.tsx means changing these.

              Also before the frame in DOM order, for the same reason: he
              starts translated a full body-length left of this slot, which
              puts him inside the photo's box with the frame painting over him,
              and walks right until he's clear. See `exy-emerge`.

              `left-full` is safe here — unlike the tail's den, this one is
              sized outright, so there's no shrink-to-fit against zero
              available width.

              183x104 is the side sprite at its render height (408x232 scaled
