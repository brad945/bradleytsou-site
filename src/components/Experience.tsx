/**
 * Work history.
 *
 * **The projects moved out**, to a Portfolio panel on `/about`, at Bradley's
 * request. This was one merged panel for a while and the merge was right at
 * the time — the split it replaced listed UCSB and BRI Youth in both halves.
 * What's left is roles only, which is what the heading now says.
 *
 * They were two panels and split the same story in half — where he worked
 * versus what he built — with UCSB and BRI Youth appearing in both. Merged,
 * and the duplicated entries were folded together rather than dropped: what
 * the standalone project rows carried (the tags, the framing) now lives on the
 * role, so one entry holds everything known about it.
 *
 * Order is manual on both lists, not sorted: Bradley wants MedImpact above
 * Crossing Hurdles even though it started a month earlier, so sorting by date
 * would fight him.
