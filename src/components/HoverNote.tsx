/**
 * A hover note, instant by default and optionally delayed.
 *
 * This exists because `title` can't be either. The native tooltip has a
 * browser-controlled delay of roughly a second that no CSS or JS can shorten
 * — too slow where a note is wanted immediately, and not adjustable where a
 * shorter pause is wanted instead.
 *
 * **The mechanism is opacity + visibility, not `hidden` -> `block`.** It used
 * to be the latter, which is simpler and appears on the same frame the pointer
 * arrives — but `display` cannot be transitioned, so a delay was impossible to
 * express. Zero duration with zero delay behaves identically to what it
 * replaced; `delay` just moves that one number.
 *
 * `visibility` is transitioned alongside `opacity` so the note is genuinely
 * absent until it appears, rather than invisible-but-present for the duration
 * of the delay.
 *
 * **`w-max` is load-bearing.** An absolutely positioned box shrink-to-fits
 * against its containing block, and here that's the `relative` span wrapping
 * the trigger — often only a few characters wide. Without `w-max` the note
 * collapses to that width and breaks one word per line. `max-w` then caps it
 * so a long note wraps at a sensible measure instead of running off-screen.
 *
 * ## Also load-bearing
 *
 * **The group is named (`group/note`).** Both call sites sit inside elements
 * that already use the default `group` for their own hover states — the nav's
 * profile link, and potentially anything wrapping the header card. An unnamed
 * group here would fire whenever the *parent* was hovered, which is a much
 * larger target than the thing the note belongs to.
 *
 * **The note is `aria-hidden`.** Where this sits inside a link, its text would
 * otherwise be appended to that link's accessible name — a screen reader would
 * read the label and the aside as one run-on string. The tradeoff is that the
 * note is visual-only; don't put anything here that isn't also conveyed some
 * other way.

   * pointer has left — which a tooltip must not do. On the hover state it
   * waits to appear and leaves at once.
   *
   * Written out in full rather than built from a number. Tailwind reads source

   * `delay-${ms}` would emit nothing and the note would appear instantly
   * whatever was passed.
