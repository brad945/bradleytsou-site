/**
 * A bookshelf you can actually poke, rather than a list of titles.
 *
 * Rendered as a **source block inside Recent Activity**, beside GitHub and
 * Spotify — it's another thing he's been doing lately, which is what that
 * panel is for. So it has no panel chrome of its own; `ActivityFeed` supplies
 * the heading and the icon.
 *
 * Books stand as spines on a shelf: hovering lifts one and lights it up,
 * clicking pulls it out and shows what it is underneath. That's the whole
 * reason it isn't a `<ul>` — a shelf is a thing you scan by eye and reach
 * into, and a list of rows is neither.
 *
 * ## Why the motion is allowed here
 *
 * The brief bans decorative animation, and this is a lot of it. It's in the
 * same category as Exy: **nothing moves unless you point at it or click it**,
 * and the motion is the affordance — a spine that didn't respond wouldn't read
 * as reachable. It's a mechanic, not an ambient effect. All of it is
 * `motion-safe`, so it collapses to a plain colour change under
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` and the shelf still works.
 *
 * ## Two things that are load-bearing
 *
 * **Spine colours are full class strings in an array, not built by index at
 * runtime.** Tailwind's scanner reads source as text; a template string would
 * emit nothing and every spine would come out transparent. Same reason the old
 * showcase spelled its rarity classes out.
 *
 * **Heights and widths are derived from the title, not random.** A shelf of
 * identical blocks reads as a chart, but `Math.random()` would reshuffle on
 * every render and re-order on hydration. Hashing the title is stable, varies
 * naturally, and means adding a book never means choosing a size.

 * sized to carry, and (as 7) as the hard floor `fontSize` clamps to if a
 * title still doesn't fit. They can disagree by 2pt without anything
 * breaking, because the height rule is a minimum and the clamp is a

 * replaced sizes hashed out of the title, under which a 656-page hardcover and
 * a 144-page play stood the same height and the shelf described nothing.
 *
 * **Thickness is exaggerated, by about 3x, and it has to be.** Sula is
 * 8in x 0.5in; at the height scale its spine would be 8px wide and a vertical
 * title does not fit in 8px. The exaggeration is one uniform factor, so every
 * book stays right *relative to* every other — which is the part a reader can
 * see — and only the absolute ratio of thickness to height is off.
 *
 * `THICK_PER_IN` is also what decides how much of the shelf the row fills: at
 * 52 the eight books plus their 20px gaps come to about 500px of the ~567px
 * opening. Raise it and they crowd the uprights; lower it and the shelf starts

 * wires just give the eye two lines whose convergence is only explicable by
 * depth.
 *
 * Each wire is one thin div standing on a front-top corner and folded back
 * about its own bottom edge, exactly like the floor and the ceiling. Solve for
 * the two numbers rather than eyeballing them: the far end has to land on the

 *
 *   length = hypot(RISE, SHELF_DEPTH)      angle = atan2(SHELF_DEPTH, RISE)
 *
 * and the browser does the rest. **The convergence is not drawn.** Both wires
 * stay at their own corner's x in world space; they lean toward each other on
 * screen only because their far ends are 110px deeper, which is the whole
 * point — it's real perspective rather than two lines angled by hand, so it
 * stays correct at any width the column takes.
 *
 * `RISE` is capped by what's above the shelf: the wires overshoot the block by

        A shelf, built as an actual box: back panel, two side walls, a floor,
        and in front of all of it a carcass — two uprights, a board across the
        top, the lip below — with the books standing inside.

        **The carcass is what gives the shelf an edge.** Without it the
        opening was a hole in nothing: the walls met the page with no
        material between them, so the whole thing read as one flat plane
        however much depth was behind it. Each board is lit across its own
        width, so it has a visible thickness the opening sits behind.

        **The books stand upright in it.** They leaned 12° forward first and
        it looked wrong for a reason worth keeping: a leaning book inside a
        square box has nothing holding it up, so the two read as separate
        objects at odds with each other. All the depth comes from the camera
        instead — `perspective-origin` sits above the box, so you look down
        into the shelf and see its floor and the tops of the books, with
        everything square to everything else. A hovered book is then the only thing in
        the scene that isn't, which is what makes it read as pulled out.

        Every face is a plain div folded into place, and each fold has one
        correct sign that is easy to get backwards — all four are spelled out
        below because getting one wrong puts a wall in front of the books
        instead of behind them, and it is not obvious from the result which
        one is at fault.

        `perspective` and `perspective-origin` live here, on the one element
        that contains the whole scene. Per-face they'd each get their own
        vanishing point and the box wouldn't close up.

                    The book's shadow on the back wall.
                    
                    The floor shadow below was the only cast shadow here, and
                    between books you mostly see the BACK of the shelf, not its
                    floor — so the one surface a reader actually looks at had
                    nothing on it. This is the missing half.

                    Where it lands follows from the light being above, in front
                    and to the left: the edge doing the casting is the book's
                    back edge, `SHELF_DEPTH - BOOK_INSET - depth` short of the
                    wall, so the
                    shadow sits just right of and below the book rather than
                    far from it. Both offsets are computed from that gap, which
                    is why a shallow book throws its shadow further than a deep
                    one — it has more room between itself and the wall.

                    It sits a pixel proud of the back panel so it can't
                    z-fight with it, and it fades as the book tips out, which
                    is what happens: a book leaning toward you stops blocking
                    the wall behind it.

                      the book was a spine and a top and nothing between them,
                      which is why it read flat however the camera moved.

                      `backface-visibility: hidden` is what makes this need no

                      Sits ABOVE the spine (`bottom-full`) and hinges at its own
                      bottom edge, so `rotateX(90deg)` folds it backward with its
                      lit side up. The earlier version hinged it at the top edge
                      with `-90`: same position, face pointing down, so what you
                      saw was its underside and it dropped out of view entirely
                      once a book tipped far enough. That was the disappearing
                      top.

                      Paper, not the cover colour. It was a darkened tint of
                      the spine, which is what a shelf never shows you: the top
                      of a book standing spine-out is its page block, and paper
                      against a coloured spine is most of what reads as a solid
                      object. The stripes run across the width because that is
                      how pages stack — the spine's width IS the thickness of
                      the stack — and each one is a single page's edge.

                      Soft-peaked rather than hard-ruled, for the same reason
                      the shelf's own grain is: a 1px line every 2.5px is below
                      the size where a screen can draw it honestly, and it
                      moirés instead. A band that fades in and out reads as
                      paper at any zoom.

            which nothing at z = 0 can be. The uprights run 14px past the box
            to carry the plinth, and the lip is inset by their width.

            The inset shadows on its two ends draw the joint. Two boards
            meeting at right angles have gradients running at right angles too,
            so their values can't match all the way along the seam however
            they're tuned — and an unexplained mismatch reads as a mistake. A
            line reads as joinery.

                shade it however you like and it stays a tape, because rotating
                the scene by a degree changes nothing about its width. A second
                copy turned 90° about the rod's own long axis gives it a
                cross-section, so it occupies volume the way every other part
                of this shelf does — which is the whole reason the shelf reads
                as an object and the wire didn't.

                `rotateY` is the right axis because inside this wrapper the
                rod's length runs along the local Y. Both blades carry the same
                cylindrical shading, so whichever one you're closer to
                edge-on with, the other is showing you a lit round surface.

                The shelf end has no separate fitting, and that is the fix

                frame has to be lined up with the rod by hand, and at 11px
                being a pixel out reads as "not connected". The ferrule below
                is a CHILD of the rod, on the rod's own axis, so it cannot be
