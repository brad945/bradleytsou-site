/**
 * Steam's own face is Motiva Sans, and the Tailwind stacks now name it first
 * so a visitor who already has it installed sees it. It can't be loaded here:
 * it's Typotheque's, licensed per-use, and self-hosting the file needs a paid
 * webfont licence. That makes it a local-only nicety, not the delivered font.
 *
 * Open Sans is what actually renders for essentially everyone. Bradley picked
 * it from a side-by-side of six free faces set in this page's own headings.
 * One family for display and body, same as Steam.
 *
 * Note its weight range starts at 300 — there is no 200. Every heading that
 * asked for `font-extralight` was moved to `font-light` rather than left to
 * clamp silently, so the CSS says the weight that actually renders.
